Beginner Repository Tutorial

This is my introductory message telling a bit about myself. 

I finally decided to have a GITHUB profile so I could pull SICP excercises from here, as well as begin my programming hobbying.
My goals, as of August 8th, 2016, are to complete the Structure and Interepretation of Computer Programs book by Dec. 31, 2016. 
A secondary goal is to learn Java, and from Java, go onto Python. Java's use in Android development will give me the ability to code an android application for my personal use.
